ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David Mascia!

## About Me
I am a results-driven software engineer and technical leader with 12+ years of experience architecting and delivering scalable full-stack applications across fintech, e-commerce, and media platforms. I specialize in building cloud-native solutions using Python, Django, Node.js, React, and distributed microservices to support millions of users and complex business workflows.

At CardCash, I helped architect a scalable e-commerce marketplace backed by InComm Payments and Guggenheim Partners, which led to a successful acquisition by RDE Inc.â€”contributing to over $100M in revenue in 2023. At Volume Media, I led the design of real-time systems for chat and order notifications, public APIs serving over 1M daily requests, and high-performance admin dashboards that significantly improved operational efficiency.

My work has supported mission-critical financial platforms used by 25+ institutions and 3M+ users, and Iâ€™ve consistently driven performance gains, reduced downtime, and improved user engagement through clean architecture and modern engineering practices. Iâ€™m looking to bring my deep expertise in backend architecture, real-time systems, and frontend excellence to a mission-aligned, remote-first engineering team focused on impact, performance, and continuous innovation.

Letâ€™s connect and discuss how we can build scalable, impactful solutions together!
