# 👋 Hi, I'm David Mascia

As a Lead Software Engineer with 20 years of experience, I build fast, scalable, and accessible user interfaces that power millions of users and global brands. I specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and have led frontend platforms for high-traffic, SEO-driven, and real-time systems.

At Volume Media, I reduced real-time chat latency by 80%, built design systems using MUI and Storybook, and deployed SSR/CSR apps with Lighthouse scores above 95. At CardCash, I scaled frontend microservices, launched 300+ white-label portals (PayPal, Amazon, St. Jude, GAP), and integrated legacy systems with modern stacks like Tailwind, React, and NestJS.

I’m passionate about performance, accessibility, developer experience, and component architecture. I’ve mentored 30+ engineers, published open-source libraries, and host Tech With Big D, a YouTube channel focused on system design and LeetCode.

I thrive in cross-functional environments and love solving complex frontend challenges that make products faster, cleaner, and more inclusive.

Let’s build something scalable together.
