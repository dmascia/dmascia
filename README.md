# 👋 Hi, I'm David Mascia

I’m a **backend-focused Senior Software Engineer and Engineering Leader** with over 15 years of experience building scalable, distributed systems using **Java (11/8), Python 3, Node.js, and TypeScript**. I’ve led teams, designed high-throughput APIs, and built cloud-native architectures across **AWS and GCP** using **Docker, Kubernetes**, and modern **DevOps** practices.

At **CardCash**, I led the transformation from a PHP monolith to microservices (**Java Spring Boot, Python Django, RabbitMQ, AWS**), helping scale the platform from **$16M to $200M** in annual revenue. At **Volume Media**, I engineered real-time systems with **WebSockets** and built low-latency streaming services that supported **10K+ concurrent users** using **Django, Redis, Celery, and GCP Media CDN**.

I’m passionate about **clean architecture, system performance**, and building infrastructure that can scale. I’ve also helped small businesses modernize their stacks as the **founder of Tech With Big D**, delivering backend solutions using **serverless AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB)**, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-first engineering.

I’m currently exploring **Staff, Lead, or Principal-level roles** where I can contribute to complex backend systems, real-time infrastructure, or high-scale platforms.
